🧠 Class in PHP

A class is a blueprint for creating objects

It defines properties (variables) and methods (functions)

Used in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Helps in code reusability

Improves program structure

Supports encapsulation and abstraction

Created using the class keyword


-------

🧩 Object in PHP

An object is an instance of a class

It is used to access properties and methods of a class

Objects represent real-world entities

Created using the new keyword

Each object has its own data

Objects help in implementing OOP concepts

Used to call class functions

----
🔒 Encapsulation in PHP

Encapsulation means binding data and methods into a single unit (class)

It is used to hide internal details of the class

Data is protected using access modifiers

Access modifiers are private, protected, public

Prevents direct access to variables

Data can be accessed using getter and setter methods

Improves security and data integrity

-------

🧬 Inheritance in PHP

Inheritance allows one class to use properties and methods of another class

The main class is called the parent (base) class

The new class is called the child (derived) class

It promotes code reusability

Avoids duplication of code

Implemented using the extends keyword

Child class can add its own features

-----

Types of Inheritance in PHP

Single Inheritance – One child class inherits one parent class

Multilevel Inheritance – A class inherits from a child class (grandparent → parent → child)

Hierarchical Inheritance – Multiple child classes inherit from one parent

Multiple Inheritance – Not supported directly in PHP (done using interfaces/traits)

Inheritance is implemented using the extends keyword

Helps in code reusability

Reduces code duplication

----

🎭 Abstraction in PHP

Abstraction means hiding implementation details and showing only essential features

It focuses on what to do, not how it works

Achieved using abstract classes or interfaces

Abstract class can have both abstract and normal methods

Abstract methods must be implemented in child class

Cannot create object of an abstract class

Improves security and reduces complexity

-------
🔥

🔄 Polymorphism in PHP

Polymorphism means one method, different behavior

Same function name can work in different ways

Achieved through method overriding

Happens when child class redefines parent method

Supports flexibility in programs

Reduces code complexity

Helps in implementing dynamic behavior
--------

🧠 OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) in PHP

OOP is a programming method based on classes and objects

It helps organize code in a structured way

Improves code reusability

Makes programs easier to maintain

Focuses on real-world entities

Supports data security

Reduces code duplication

Used in large web applications

---------

🧩 Traits in PHP

Traits are used to reuse code in multiple classes

They solve the problem of multiple inheritance in PHP

A trait can contain methods and properties

Defined using the trait keyword

Included in a class using the use keyword

Helps avoid code duplication

Improves code modularity
---------

✨ Magic Methods in PHP

Magic methods are special predefined functions in PHP

Their names start with double underscores __

They are automatically called when certain actions happen

Used in Object-Oriented Programming

Help control object behavior

Used for constructor, destructor, overloading, etc.

Improve flexibility of classes


-------

🏗 Constructor in PHP (__construct)

A constructor is a special method in a class

It runs automatically when an object is created

Used to initialize class properties

Helps set default values

Its name is __construct()

Can accept parameters

Improves object setup process

----

.

💥 Destructor in PHP (__destruct)

A destructor is a special method in a class

It runs automatically when an object is destroyed

Used to perform cleanup tasks

Helps close database connections

Used to free resources

Its name is __destruct()

Called at the end of script execution

--------

JOIN in SQL

JOIN is used to combine data from two or more tables

Works using a common column (usually primary & foreign key)

Helps fetch related data in one query

Used in database-driven applications

Improves data retrieval

Essential in relational databases


--------


🐘 PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor)

Server-side scripting language

Used to create dynamic web pages

Runs on server, output shown in browser

Open-source and free

Supports databases like MySQL

Can be embedded in HTML

Platform independent

⭐ Features of PHP

Open-source

Easy to learn

Fast performance

Supports multiple databases

Platform independent

Secure for web apps

Supports OOP

🍪 Cookies

Stored in user’s browser

Saves user information

Used for login and preferences

Has expiry time

Small amount of data

Created using setcookie()

🔐 Session

Stores data on server

Maintains user login state

More secure than cookies

Starts with session_start()

Data accessed using $_SESSION

Ends when browser closes or session destroyed

🧠 OOPS Concepts

Encapsulation – binding data and methods

Abstraction – hiding internal details

Inheritance – one class uses another

Polymorphism – same method, different behavior

Class & Object – blueprint and instance

📤 GET

Data sent through URL

Less secure

Limited data size

Used for search requests

Visible in browser address bar

📥 POST

Data sent in background

More secure

No size limit

Used for login/forms

Not visible in URL

🖨 echo

Displays output

Faster than print

Can print multiple values

No return value

🖨 print

Displays output

Slower than echo

Returns value 1

Prints one argument

🖨 print_r

Prints arrays and objects

Human-readable format

Used for debugging

🖨 var_dump

Shows data type and value

Displays string length

Used for debugging complex variables
