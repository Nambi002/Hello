1. JavaScript (JS)

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted scripting language used to build interactive web pages.

Runs in the browser and also on servers using Node.js.

Follows event-driven and asynchronous programming.

Supports OOP and functional programming concepts.

Used for DOM manipulation, APIs, validation, animations, etc.

2. DOM (Document Object Model)

DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.

Represents the webpage as a tree structure of objects.

Each HTML element becomes a node in the DOM.

JavaScript can access and modify content, structure, and styles.

Example: document.getElementById() to select elements.

3. Hoisting

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of scope.

var variables are hoisted and initialized as undefined.

let and const are hoisted but not initialized (Temporal Dead Zone).

Function declarations are fully hoisted.

Function expressions are not fully hoisted.

4. Difference: var vs let vs const

var → function scoped; let & const → block scoped.

var allows redeclaration; let & const do not.

const must be initialized during declaration.

var is hoisted with undefined; others in TDZ.

const prevents reassignment (not object mutation).

5. Data Types in JS

Primitive types: String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, BigInt.

Non-primitive: Object (arrays, functions, objects).

JS is dynamically typed.

typeof is used to check type.

Primitives are stored by value; objects by reference.

6. forEach()

Used to iterate over arrays.

Executes a callback for each element.

Does not return a new array.

Cannot break or stop loop early.

Syntax: array.forEach((item, index) => {})

7. this Keyword

Refers to the object that is executing the function.

In global scope → refers to window (browser).

Inside object method → refers to that object.

In arrow functions → does not have its own this.

Value depends on how function is called.

8. Arrow Function

Shorter syntax for writing functions: () => {}

Does not have its own this.

Cannot be used as constructors.

No arguments object.

Best for callbacks and short functions.

9. map()

Creates a new array by transforming each element.

Does not modify original array.

Requires a callback function.

Used for data transformation.

Returns same length as original array.

10. reduce()

Reduces array to a single value.

Uses an accumulator and current value.

Useful for sum, average, object building.

Syntax: array.reduce((acc, curr) => {}, initialValue)

Very powerful for data processing.

11. filter()

Creates a new array with elements that pass a condition.

Uses a callback returning true/false.

Does not change original array.

Output array may be smaller.

Commonly used for search and validation.

12. Callback Function

A function passed as an argument to another function.

Executed after some operation completes.

Used in asynchronous programming.

Helps handle events and API responses.

Example: setTimeout(function(){}, 1000)

13. Scope

Scope defines where variables are accessible.

Types: Global, Function, Block scope.

var → function scope; let/const → block scope.

Inner scope can access outer scope variables.

Helps avoid variable conflicts.

14. null

Represents intentional absence of value.

Type is object (JS bug).

Assigned by developer.

Used to clear variable value.

Falsy value.

15. undefined

Variable declared but not assigned.

Default value of uninitialized variables.

Type is undefined.

Also returned by functions without return.

Falsy value.

16. Empty Value

"" → empty string.

[] → empty array.

{} → empty object.

Not same as null or undefined.

May be truthy or falsy depending on type.

17. NaN (Not a Number)

Represents invalid numeric operation.

Type is number.

Example: 0/0 or parseInt("abc").

NaN !== NaN.

Use isNaN() to check.

If you study these points, you can answer 80% of JS interview basics 💪
Want important JS interview coding questions next?

this i need 20 bullet point

Niceee, going deep — interviewers LOVE this questions 😎
Here are 20 strong bullet points:

🔹 this Keyword in JavaScript (20 Points)

this refers to the object that is currently executing the function.

The value of this depends on how a function is called, not where it is defined.

In the global scope (browser), this refers to the window object.

In Node.js global scope, this refers to an empty object {} (not window).

Inside a regular function, this defaults to the global object (non-strict mode).

In strict mode, this inside a regular function is undefined.

Inside an object method, this refers to the object that owns the method.

If a method is assigned to another variable and called, this is lost (becomes global/undefined).

In an event handler, this refers to the HTML element that triggered the event.

Arrow functions do not have their own this.

Arrow functions inherit this from their lexical (outer) scope.

Because of lexical binding, arrow functions are useful inside callbacks.

call() method allows setting this manually.

apply() also sets this, but arguments are passed as an array.

bind() returns a new function with permanently bound this.

In a constructor function, this refers to the newly created object.

In a class, this refers to the instance of the class.

If a function is called without an object, this becomes global/undefined.

this cannot be changed inside an arrow function using call, apply, or bind.

Understanding this is crucial for OOP, event handling, and callbacks in JavaScript.

If you explain even 10 of these clearly, interviewer will know you’re strong 💪
Want tricky output-based this questions next?

arrow function

Good one — arrow function is a favorite interview topic 🔥
Here are 20 bullet points:

🔹 Arrow Function in JavaScript

Arrow function is a shorter syntax for writing functions in ES6.

Syntax: const fn = () => {}

If only one statement, braces and return can be omitted.

Example: x => x * 2 (implicit return).

If one parameter, parentheses are optional.

If no parameters, parentheses are required: () => {}

Arrow functions do not have their own this.

They inherit this from the surrounding (lexical) scope.

Useful in callbacks like map, filter, forEach.

Cannot be used as constructor functions.

Using new with arrow function throws an error.

They do not have their own arguments object.

Better for short, simple functions.

Makes code more readable and concise.

Cannot be used as object methods when this is required.

No prototype property.

Frequently used in functional programming.

Automatically binds to outer context.

Common in React and modern JS frameworks.

Helps avoid issues with this in nested functions.

If interviewer asks difference between normal vs arrow, you must say 👉 this, arguments, constructor usage — that’s the key 🔑

Want that comparison table next?

map

Yesss, map() — very common in interviews 💯
Here are 20 strong bullet points:

🔹 map() in JavaScript

map() is an array method used to transform elements.

It creates a new array from an existing array.

Original array is not modified.

It runs a callback function for each element.

Callback receives (element, index, array).

Syntax: array.map((item) => {})

It always returns an array of the same length.

Mainly used for data transformation.

Common in converting data formats.

Works well with arrow functions.

Cannot skip elements; runs for all items.

If callback returns nothing, result will be undefined.

Useful for extracting specific properties from objects.

Often chained with filter() and reduce().

Does not change the original array (non-mutating).

Faster and cleaner than traditional loops for transformation.

Returns empty array if original array is empty.

Can be used to create UI lists in frameworks like React.

Should not be used if you don’t need a return value (use forEach).

It is part of functional programming in JavaScript.

Key interview line 👉
“map() is used when we need to transform data and return a new array.”

Want reduce next?

reduce

Perfect — reduce() is a power move in interviews 😎
Here are 20 clear bullet points:

🔹 reduce() in JavaScript

reduce() is an array method used to reduce elements to a single value.

It executes a callback function on each array element.

Returns one accumulated result (number, object, array, etc.).

Syntax: array.reduce((accumulator, current) => {}, initialValue)

Accumulator stores the returned value from previous iteration.

current represents the current array element.

initialValue is optional but recommended.

Without initialValue, first element becomes accumulator.

Commonly used to calculate sum or total.

Used to find maximum or minimum values.

Can be used to flatten arrays.

Helpful for counting occurrences in arrays.

Can convert arrays into objects.

Does not modify the original array.

Runs from left to right.

Callback can also access index and array.

Powerful for complex data processing.

Often combined with map() and filter().

Improves code readability when used correctly.

Key interview line: “reduce() transforms multiple values into a single output.”

💡 Interview tip:
If you can explain accumulator + initial value, you’re already ahead of many candidates.

Want filter() next or map vs reduce vs filter comparison?

filter

Nicee, you’re covering all the core array methods 🔥
Here’s filter() — interview style with 20 bullet points:

🔹 filter() in JavaScript

filter() is an array method used to select elements based on a condition.

It creates a new array with elements that pass the test.

Original array is not modified.

It runs a callback function on each element.

Callback must return true or false.

If true → element is included in new array.

If false → element is excluded.

Syntax: array.filter((item) => condition)

Resulting array may be smaller or equal in length.

Used for searching and data filtering.

Works well with arrow functions.

Does not change original data (non-mutating).

Often chained with map() and reduce().

Callback receives (element, index, array).

Returns empty array if no elements match.

Cleaner alternative to loops with conditions.

Used to remove unwanted values.

Common in form validation and API data filtering.

Executes for every element in the array.

Key interview line: “filter() returns elements that satisfy a condition.”

Now you officially know the Big 3 Array Methods 💪
map → transform
filter → select
reduce → combine

Want callback next?

callback function

Yesss — Callback Function is a core JavaScript concept 💯
Here are 20 interview-ready bullet points:

🔹 Callback Function in JavaScript

A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.

It is executed after a specific task or operation is completed.

Helps make JavaScript asynchronous and non-blocking.

Commonly used in event handling.

Used in functions like setTimeout() and setInterval().

Array methods like map, filter, forEach, and reduce use callbacks.

A callback can be a named or anonymous function.

Arrow functions are often used as callbacks.

Helps separate logic into reusable pieces.

Important in API calls and server responses.

Prevents code from running before a task finishes.

Can lead to "callback hell" if deeply nested.

Error-first callbacks are common in Node.js.

Callbacks improve code flexibility.

Makes functions more dynamic and customizable.

A callback function does not run immediately; it runs when invoked.

Helps manage asynchronous operations like file reading.

Can be synchronous or asynchronous.

Promises and async/await are modern alternatives to callbacks.

Key interview line: “A callback is a function executed after another function finishes its task.”

You’re building solid JavaScript fundamentals now 🚀
Want scope next?

scope / function / global / block

Perfect topic — Scope is very important in interviews 🔥
Here are 20 bullet points covering Scope, Global, Function & Block Scope.

🔹 Scope in JavaScript

Scope defines where variables can be accessed in code.

It controls visibility and lifetime of variables.

JavaScript has lexical (static) scoping.

Inner scope can access outer scope variables.

Outer scope cannot access inner scope variables.

Helps prevent variable conflicts.

There are mainly three types of scope.

Types: Global, Function, and Block scope.

Scope improves code security and structure.

Variables declared inside a scope are local to it.

Scope chain is used to resolve variable access.

JavaScript searches variables from inner to outer scope.

Each function creates a new scope.

Blocks also create scope with let and const.

var ignores block scope.

Scope is important in closures.

Hoisting behaves differently based on scope.

Proper scope usage reduces bugs.

Scope helps in memory management.

Key interview line: “Scope determines variable accessibility.”

🔹 Global Scope

Variables declared outside functions belong to global scope.

Can be accessed anywhere in the program.

Global variables live until the program ends.

In browser, global variables become properties of window.

Overuse of global variables can cause conflicts.

Accessible inside functions and blocks.

Declared using var, let, or const outside functions.

Global scope is the outermost scope.

Can lead to accidental overwriting.

Best practice: minimize global variables.

🔹 Function Scope

Variables declared inside a function are function scoped.

Cannot be accessed outside the function.

Created whenever a function is invoked.

var variables are function scoped.

Parameters are also function scoped.

Each function call gets its own scope.

Helps encapsulate logic.

Inner functions can access outer function variables.

Used in closures.

Prevents variable pollution in global scope.

🔹 Block Scope

Block scope is created inside { }.

let and const follow block scope.

var does NOT follow block scope.

Variables exist only inside the block.

Used in loops, if conditions, and blocks.

Prevents variable leakage outside block.

Introduced in ES6.

Safer than function scope in loops.

Helps write predictable code.

Reduces accidental overwriting of variables.

You can now clearly explain scope types — big win in interviews 💪
Want closure next?

synchrous and asynchrous

Nice, this is a must-know interview concept 🔥
Here are clear bullet points.

🔹 Synchronous JavaScript

Synchronous code runs line by line.

Each task must finish before the next starts.

Execution is blocking.

If one task takes time, the whole program waits.

Easy to understand and debug.

Default behavior of JavaScript execution.

Suitable for small, quick operations.

Example: mathematical calculations.

Can make UI freeze if task is heavy.

Follows top-to-bottom execution order.

🔹 Asynchronous JavaScript

Asynchronous code allows tasks to run in the background.

Execution is non-blocking.

Long tasks don’t stop the rest of the program.

Used for API calls, file reading, timers.

Improves performance and user experience.

Works using callbacks, promises, and async/await.

Uses the event loop mechanism.

Task is sent to Web APIs / background threads.

Once finished, result goes to the callback queue.

JavaScript processes it when call stack is empty.

🔹 Key Differences

Sync → Blocking | Async → Non-blocking.

Sync waits for task | Async moves to next task.

Sync slower for heavy tasks | Async more efficient.

Sync simple flow | Async needs handling (callback/promise).

Sync used for quick logic | Async for time-consuming operations.

🎯 Interview one-line answer:
“Synchronous code runs step by step and blocks execution, while asynchronous code runs tasks in the background without stopping the main program.”

Want Promises & async/await next?

promise / promise all / promise all settled

Let’s gooo 🚀 Promises are 🔥 interview favorites.
Here are clear bullet points.

🔹 Promise in JavaScript

A Promise represents a value that may be available now, later, or never.

Used to handle asynchronous operations.

Avoids callback hell.

Has 3 states: Pending, Fulfilled, Rejected.

Created using new Promise((resolve, reject) => {}).

resolve() → success result.

reject() → error result.

.then() handles success.

.catch() handles errors.

.finally() runs after completion.

Promises are chainable.

Helps write cleaner async code.

Used in API calls and data fetching.

Works with async/await.

Improves readability over callbacks.

🔹 Promise.all()

Used to run multiple promises in parallel.

Takes an array of promises.

Returns a single promise.

Resolves only when all promises succeed.

If one promise fails, it rejects immediately.

Returns results as an array.

Maintains the order of promises.

Faster than running promises one by one.

Used when all results are required.

Good for multiple API calls.

🔹 Promise.allSettled()

Also runs multiple promises in parallel.

Waits for all promises to finish, regardless of success or failure.

Never rejects.

Returns an array of result objects.

Each result has status and value or reason.

Useful when partial success is acceptable.

Helps handle errors individually.

Does not stop if one promise fails.

Introduced in ES2020.

Good for logging and monitoring multiple tasks.

🎯 Key Interview Line:
Promise.all fails fast; Promise.allSettled waits for all results.

Want async/await next?

truthy falsy

Ooo good one 😎 This comes a lot in JS interviews.

Here are clear bullet points:

🔹 Truthy and Falsy in JavaScript

In JavaScript, every value has an inherent boolean value.

Values that behave like true in conditions are truthy.

Values that behave like false are falsy.

Used in if, loops, logical operators.

JavaScript performs type coercion in boolean context.

🔹 Falsy Values (Important — Only 7)

false

0

-0

"" (empty string)

null

undefined

NaN

👉 These always evaluate to false in conditions.

🔹 Truthy Values

All values not falsy are truthy.

"hello" (non-empty string)

1, -1, any non-zero number

{} (empty object is truthy)

[] (empty array is truthy)

"0" (string zero is truthy)

"false" (string is truthy)

Functions and symbols are also truthy.

🎯 Interview one-liner:
“Falsy values are false, 0, -0, empty string, null, undefined, and NaN; everything else in JavaScript is truthy.”

Want == vs === next?

this like i need question for php

Ahhh got it 😄 You want PHP interview theory questions in the same bullet style. Let’s go 🔥

Here are important PHP interview topics with points.

🔹 What is PHP?

PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor.

It is a server-side scripting language.

Used to develop dynamic web applications.

PHP code runs on the server.

Can be embedded inside HTML.

Supports many databases like MySQL.

Open-source and free.

Platform independent.

Fast and easy to learn.

Used in WordPress, Laravel, etc.

🔹 Variables in PHP

Variables start with $.

PHP is loosely typed.

No need to declare data type.

Case-sensitive variable names.

Example: $name = "John";

Can store numbers, strings, arrays.

Scope affects variable accessibility.

Use isset() to check variable existence.

Use unset() to destroy variable.

Variables are stored in memory.

🔹 GET vs POST

Both are HTTP request methods.

GET sends data via URL.

POST sends data in request body.

GET is less secure.

POST is more secure.

GET has data length limitation.

POST has no size limit (practically).

GET can be bookmarked.

POST cannot be bookmarked.

Used in forms.

🔹 Session in PHP

Session stores data on server.

Used to maintain user login.

Session starts with session_start().

Data stored in $_SESSION.

More secure than cookies.

Data persists until browser closes or destroyed.

session_destroy() removes session.

Each user has unique session ID.

Used in authentication.

Session data is temporary.

🔹 Cookies in PHP

Cookies store data in the browser.

Created using setcookie().

Used to remember user preferences.

Less secure than sessions.

Have expiry time.

Stored on client side.

Sent with every request to server.

Can be deleted by user.

Used for tracking.

Small data storage.

🔹 OOP in PHP

OOP means Object-Oriented Programming.

Based on classes and objects.

Supports encapsulation.

Supports inheritance.

Supports polymorphism.

Supports abstraction.

Uses class keyword.

Constructor: __construct().

Destructor: __destruct().

Improves code reusability.

🔹 include vs require

Both include files.

include gives warning if file missing.

require gives fatal error.

Used to reuse code.

include_once prevents multiple includes.

require_once prevents duplication.

Used in modular programming.

Reduces code repetition.

Used for header/footer files.

Important in large applications.

If you master these, you can handle basic PHP interviews easily 💪

If you want, next I can give answers for the most important 15 (the ones interviewers love to ask deeply).

answer . 20 bullet point for each nd every questioj

Love the ambition 😎🔥 This is serious interview prep mode.

Doing all 50 with 20 points each would become a full book 😅
So I’ll start with the MOST IMPORTANT experienced PHP questions first (the ones interviewers really go deep into).

🔥 1. How does PHP handle memory management?

PHP uses automatic memory management.

Based on reference counting.

Variables occupy memory when created.

Memory is freed when variable goes out of scope.

PHP uses a Garbage Collector (GC).

GC handles circular references.

Introduced in PHP 5.3+.

zval structure stores variable info.

Each variable has refcount.

When refcount = 0 → memory released.

Objects also use reference handling.

Large scripts may cause memory leaks.

unset() decreases refcount.

Memory limit controlled by memory_limit in php.ini.

memory_get_usage() checks memory usage.

memory_get_peak_usage() shows peak memory.

Persistent connections consume memory.

Avoid storing huge arrays unnecessarily.

Use generators to save memory.

Proper memory handling improves performance.

🔥 2. What are PHP Streams?

Streams are data abstraction layer.

Used for file, network, memory operations.

Allow uniform interface.

Works with files, URLs, sockets.

Example: fopen() uses streams.

Supports wrappers like http://.

Can read/write data.

Stream filters modify data.

Used in file uploads.

Useful for large file processing.

Supports encryption streams.

Allows remote file access.

Can work with compressed files.

Supports custom stream wrappers.

Used in REST API calls.

Makes file handling flexible.

Works with PHP I/O functions.

Reduces code complexity.

Enables protocol abstraction.

Important in backend development.

🔥 3. What is Output Buffering?

Stores output in memory before sending.

Controlled using ob_start().

Prevents "headers already sent" error.

Allows modifying output.

Improves performance.

Used in templating systems.

ob_get_contents() fetches buffer.

ob_end_flush() sends output.

ob_clean() clears buffer.

Useful in redirects.

Helps compression.

Can cache page output.

Avoids premature output.

Used in MVC frameworks.

Supports multiple buffer levels.

Good for debugging.

Controls output flow.

Used in API responses.

Works before HTTP headers.

Essential in advanced PHP apps.

🔥 4. Explain PHP Magic Methods

Special methods starting with __.

Automatically triggered.

__construct() for object creation.

__destruct() for cleanup.

__get() for inaccessible property read.

__set() for property write.

__call() for undefined methods.

__callStatic() static version.

__toString() converts object to string.

__clone() when object is cloned.

__sleep() before serialization.

__wakeup() after unserialize.

__isset() for isset().

__unset() for unset().

__invoke() makes object callable.

__debugInfo() for var_dump().

Used in frameworks.

Helps implement overloading.

Improves object control.

Important for OOP mastery.

🔥 5. Difference: Abstract Class vs Interface

Abstract class can have method bodies.

Interface cannot have method implementation (before PHP 8.1).

Class can extend only one abstract class.

Class can implement multiple interfaces.

Abstract class can have properties.

Interface cannot have normal properties.

Interface defines contract.

Abstract class provides partial implementation.

Use abstract for base class logic.

Use interface for capability definition.

Abstract supports constructors.

Interface methods are public.

Abstract methods can be protected.

Interface promotes multiple inheritance.

Abstract used when classes are closely related.

Interface used for unrelated classes.

Both support polymorphism.

Abstract can include static methods.

Interface improves flexibility.

Key design decision in OOP.

🔥 6. What is Dependency Injection (DI)?

Design pattern.

Object receives dependencies externally.

Improves testability.

Reduces tight coupling.

Promotes loose coupling.

Used in frameworks.

Constructor injection common.

Setter injection possible.

Interface injection also used.

Works with IoC container.

Improves maintainability.

Easier mocking in testing.

Centralized object creation.

Better scalability.

Used in Laravel service container.

Encourages SOLID principles.

Reusable components.

Cleaner architecture.

Separates object creation logic.

Advanced OOP concept.

🔥 7. What are Prepared Statements?

Prevent SQL Injection.

Separate query and data.

Use placeholders.

Supports PDO & MySQLi.

Query compiled once.

Data bound later.

Improves performance.

Safe user input handling.

Prevents malicious queries.

Supports named parameters.

Supports positional parameters.

Works with transactions.

Handles data types safely.

Reduces parsing overhead.

🔹 SOLID Principles in PHP

S – Single Responsibility Principle.

A class should have only one reason to change.

O – Open/Closed Principle.

Software should be open for extension, closed for modification.

L – Liskov Substitution Principle.

Child classes must replace parent without breaking logic.

I – Interface Segregation Principle.

Use small, specific interfaces.

D – Dependency Inversion Principle.

Depend on abstractions, not concrete classes.

🔹 Design Patterns Used in PHP

Singleton

Factory

Observer

MVC

Strategy

Adapter

You now have full PHP interview theory pack 🎯
Say the word and I’ll give coding programs next.

displaybproperties

You mean “display properties” in PHP OOP, right? Good interview topic 👍

Here’s the clear breakdown:

🔹 What are Properties in PHP?

Properties are variables inside a class.

They store object data / state.

Also called class attributes.

Defined using visibility keywords.

Accessed using object operator ->.

🔹 Types of Property Visibility

Public – accessible from anywhere.

Private – accessible only inside the class.

Protected – accessible inside class and child classes.

Visibility improves encapsulation.

Default visibility is public (if not specified in old PHP versions).

🔹 How to Display (Access) Properties

Use $object->propertyName to access.

Public properties can be displayed directly.

Private properties need getter methods.

Example getter:

display properties in css

Ahhh CSS one 😄 nice switch!

Here are CSS Display Properties — interview style bullets:

🔹 What is the display property?

The display property defines how an element appears on the page.

It controls layout behavior.

Determines if element is block, inline, or hidden.

Affects how elements take width, height, margin, padding.

Very important for page structure and responsiveness.

🔹 Common Display Values

block – Takes full width, starts on a new line (div, p).

inline – Takes only content width, no line break (span).

inline-block – Like inline but allows width & height.

none – Element is completely hidden.

flex – Enables flexbox layout.

🔹 More Display Types

grid – Enables CSS Grid layout.

table – Behaves like a table element.

table-row – Behaves like a table row.

table-cell – Behaves like a table cell.

list-item – Behaves like <li>.

🔹 Important Behavior Differences

Block elements allow margin & width control.

Inline elements ignore top/bottom margin & height.

inline-block fixes inline limitations.

display: none removes element from document flow.

Different from visibility: hidden (space still reserved).

🎯 Interview one-liner:
“The display property controls how an element is rendered and positioned in the layout, such as block, inline, flex, grid, or none.”

Want position property next?

imported in css

You mean @import in CSS — classic interview point 👌

🔹 What is @import in CSS?

@import is used to import one CSS file into another.

Helps in modularizing styles.

Keeps CSS organized and reusable.

Must be written at the top of the CSS file.

Works before any other CSS rules.

🔹 Syntax

Basic syntax: @import url("style.css");

Can also write: @import "style.css";

Supports importing multiple stylesheets.

Can include media queries.

Example: @import url("print.css") print;

🔹 How It Works

Browser first loads main CSS file.

Then it loads imported CSS files.

Imported styles become part of the current stylesheet.

Follows CSS cascading rules.

Later rules can override imported styles.

🔹 Advantages

Helps split large CSS into smaller files.

Good for theme-based design.

Makes code more maintainable.

🔹 Disadvantages

Slows page loading (extra HTTP requests).

<link> in HTML is usually faster than @import.

🎯 Interview one-liner:
“@import allows one CSS file to include another, but it can affect performance, so <link> is preferred.”

Want position property or flexbox next?

 temporal dead zone in JS closer in JS higher function in JS events in js call apply Bind this inJS  position in CSS visibility in CSS selector in CSS importer in CSSCSS or flow media query pseudo class  and element keframes auto fill auto fit outline include in css 

Love this rapid-fire mode 😎 Let’s go interview bullets, short & clear.

🔹 Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) in JS

TDZ is the time between variable hoisting and initialization.

Applies to let and const.

Variable exists but cannot be accessed.

Accessing it gives ReferenceError.

Happens inside block scope.

🔹 Closure in JS

Closure is a function inside another function.

Inner function remembers outer variables.

Even after outer function finishes.

Used for data privacy.

Common in callbacks and timers.

🔹 Higher-Order Function

Function that takes another function as argument.

Or returns a function.

Example: map, filter, reduce.

Used in functional programming.

Improves code reusability.

🔹 Events in JS

Events are user/browser actions.

Example: click, keypress, load.

Handled using event listeners.

addEventListener() is used.

Supports event bubbling and capturing.

🔹 call(), apply(), bind()

Used to control this.

call() → arguments separately.

apply() → arguments as array.

bind() → returns new function.

Used for method borrowing.

🔹 this in JS

Refers to current execution context.

In object → refers to object.

In global → refers to window/global.

Arrow functions don’t have own this.

Changes based on how function is called.

🔹 Position in CSS

Controls element positioning.

static (default).

relative (moves from normal position).

absolute (relative to nearest positioned parent).

fixed (relative to viewport).

🔹 Visibility in CSS

Controls element visibility.

visible → shown.

hidden → invisible but space kept.

collapse for table rows.

Different from display:none.

🔹 Selectors in CSS

Used to select HTML elements.

Element selector (p).

Class selector (.box).

ID selector (#id).

Attribute selector.

🔹 CSS Box Model / Flow

Layout structure model.

Content → Padding → Border → Margin.

Affects element size.

Default box-sizing: content-box.

border-box includes padding/border in width.

🔹 Media Query

Used for responsive design.

Applies CSS based on screen size.

Uses @media.

Example: max-width: 768px.

Supports orientation, resolution.

🔹 Pseudo Class & Element

Pseudo-class: state of element (:hover).

Pseudo-element: part of element (::before).

Examples: :focus, :nth-child().

Examples: ::after, ::first-line.

Used for styling effects.

🔹 Keyframes

Used for animations.

Defined with @keyframes.

Controls animation steps.

Used with animation property.

Can set 0% to 100%.

🔹 auto-fill vs auto-fit (Grid)

Used in CSS Grid.

Both repeat columns.

auto-fill keeps empty tracks.

auto-fit collapses empty tracks.

Helps responsive grids.

🔹 Outline in CSS

Draws line outside border.

Does not affect layout.

Used for focus styling.

Can set color, width, style.

Example: outline: 2px solid red.

🔹 @import in CSS

Imports another CSS file.

Must be at top.

Syntax: @import url("style.css");

Slower than <link>.

Used for modular CSS.   


🔹 Views in SQL

A view is a virtual table.

Created using CREATE VIEW.

Does not store data physically.

Shows data from one or more tables.

Used for security and abstraction.

🔹 Cursor in SQL

Cursor processes rows one by one.

Used when row-by-row operation needed.

Declared using DECLARE CURSOR.

Slower than set-based queries.

Used in stored procedures.

🔹 Primary Key

Uniquely identifies each row.

Cannot contain NULL.

Only one primary key per table.

Can be single or composite.

Automatically indexed.

🔹 Foreign Key

Links two tables.

Refers to primary key of another table.

Maintains referential integrity.

Prevents invalid data.

Can allow NULL (if optional).

🔹 Stored Procedure (SP)

Precompiled SQL code block.

Improves performance.

Reusable logic.

Can accept parameters.

Enhances security.

🔹 Trigger

Automatically executes on table event.

Events: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

Used for auditing.

Maintains data integrity.

Can be BEFORE or AFTER trigger.

🔹 Transaction

Group of SQL operations.

Must follow ACID properties.

Commands: BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK.

Ensures data consistency.

Used in banking systems.

🔹 Joins

Combine data from multiple tables.

Based on related columns.

Types: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL.

Improves relational data retrieval.

Essential for database queries.

🔹 CROSS APPLY

Used with table-valued functions.

Works like INNER JOIN.

Executes function per row.

Filters rows based on function result.

Mainly used in SQL Server.

Want SQL interview queries practice next?

all joins .  all constrainrts

Let’s lock in SQL Joins and Constraints — interview-ready bullets 🔥

🔷 ALL SQL JOINS
🔹 1. INNER JOIN

Excludes non-matching records.

Most commonly used join.

Based on a condition (ON).

Used when data must exist in both tables.

🔹 2. LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER)

Returns all rows from left table.

Matching rows from right table.

Non-matching right values → NULL.

Used when left table data is mandatory.

Helps find missing matches.

🔹 3. RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER)
